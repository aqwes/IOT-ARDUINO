# IOT-ARDUINO

A school project where we will setup an Arduino Board and connect it with an Android device connected with IBM Bluemix.

The purpose of the project is to detect movements that the carrier of the wristband(Arduino Uno) makes. We will then detect wich direction the movements were made in and trigger different functions.
